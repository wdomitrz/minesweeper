// Browser lifecycle/cache plumbing only; all app logic remains Rust.
//
// The whole worker is install, activate, fetch. Four rules hold it together:
//
// * Every path is relative to `self.location`, so the app installs and works
//   from whatever subdirectory it is published under.
// * The cache name is content-versioned by `build.rs`, which hashes the bytes
//   of every other shell file — the wasm included — and this template. Change
//   the app, or this caching logic, and the cache name changes with it.
// * `skipWaiting` exists, but only when a page asks for it by name. Never on
//   install, because that swaps the wasm out from under a live game. The page
//   asks from Rust once it has decided it can reload — see `keep_offline` in
//   `src/ui.rs`. Without this listener a new version installs and then waits
//   until every tab closes, which on a phone can be days: the app keeps working
//   and never updates, and nothing about the page suggests why.
// * The manifest is never answered from the cache. It is fetched by the browser
//   manager, not by the page, and a stale copy pins an installed app to an old
//   name, icon and start URL long after the site has moved on.
// * The fetch handler only ever answers for a URL inside this app's own
//   directory, checked on every request rather than assumed from the scope.
//   Scope is a registration's claim, not a promise, and these apps share one
//   origin with pages that are not this app.
