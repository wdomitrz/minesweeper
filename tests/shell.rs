//! Invariants of the committed shell, and of what is and is not committed.
//!
//! Everything here reads committed files. `dist/` is build output and is
//! gitignored, so the release gate — which exports the candidate tree — never
//! has it and cannot build it: that needs the wasm target and a pinned
//! `wasm-bindgen` CLI. A test asserting on `dist/` would therefore run only in
//! a developer's checkout, which is exactly where it is least likely to catch
//! anything. What covers the built output is running the two build steps in the
//! order AGENTS.md gives them, and `.github/workflows/build.yml` does that on
//! every push.
//!
//! What these tests do protect is that the shell cannot quietly grow
//! application JavaScript again, cannot point anywhere absolute, cannot commit a
//! generated file, and cannot lose the icon that every install icon is derived
//! from. Each of those has been true of a real version of this repository.
