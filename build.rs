//! Write the site to `dist/` while the crate compiles.
//!
//! The app is a static site, so publishing it is a file copy plus three small
//! derivations. `dist/` is the whole product and the only copy: eight files,
//! from two builds.
//!
//! | `dist/` file      | written by |
//! |-------------------|------------|
//! | `app.js`          | `wasm-bindgen`, after the wasm build |
//! | `app_bg.wasm`     | `wasm-bindgen`, after the wasm build |
//! | `index.html`      | this script, from `src/ui.html`, byte for byte |
//! | `service-worker.js` | this script, `__VERSION__` substituted |
//! | `icon.svg`        | this script, from `assets/icon.svg` |
//! | `icon-192.png`    | this script, rasterized from `assets/icon.svg` |
//! | `icon-512.png`    | this script, rasterized from `assets/icon.svg` |
//! | `manifest.webmanifest` | this script, assembled from `MANIFEST` |
//! | (the eight above) | hashed into the worker's cache version |
//!
//! The SVG is published as well as rasterized, and that is not optional: the
//! page links it as the favicon and the worker precaches it, and a URL that
//! 404s does not merely fail one request — `caches.addAll` rejects the whole
//! install if any listed URL is missing, so an un-published icon leaves the app
//! with no service worker and no offline support at all, presenting as a
//! mysterious caching bug rather than as a missing file.
//!
//! **Order matters.** The cache version is derived from the bytes of every
//! other shell file, including the wasm, so this script must run *after*
//! `wasm-bindgen`. Run it first and it pins a version to whatever the previous
//! build left behind — a service worker that never invalidates, shipping an app
//! older than its own cache name. That is why AGENTS.md and the workflow both
//! run the wasm step first, and why that step ends with
//! `touch build.rs && cargo build --release`: this script writes into the
//! source tree rather than `OUT_DIR`, so cargo cannot see that its output
//! changed and would otherwise skip the second, otherwise identical build.
//!
//! Two details that have each cost somebody an hour:
//!
//! * It watches **source** paths, not output names. Cargo compares these
//!   against real files, so watching `dist/index.html` watches a file that
//!   never changes and the script then never re-runs.
//! * It writes each file under a scratch name and renames it over its target,
//!   so a host serving `dist/` never serves a half-written file. And it writes
//!   *in place* rather than replacing the directory, because the two wasm
//!   artefacts live there and are not ours to delete.
